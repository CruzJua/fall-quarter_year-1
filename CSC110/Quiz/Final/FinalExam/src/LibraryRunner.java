//    Responsible for demonstrating your library works
//    Calls methods and passes data to the library
//    Getting data from the library to display the collection of games by calling displayLibraryArray (passing your game array)
//    Game class:
//    Constructor
//            Name
//    Is Favorite (Keep track of whether it is a favorite or not)
//    Know how to display itself in a string format
//    Library class (not the same as LibraryRunner):
//    Manages the collection of games
//    Should allow at least 25 games
//    Should use a basic array of games to store instances of your games
//    No use of ArrayList or List is allowed
//    Your array should be private in the library class
//    Your library must support the following features:
//    For the following features:
//    When searching the name field, it should be considered case insensitive (i.e. Minecraft, minecraft and MineCraft are all equal)
//    Features:
//    Adding a new game by name (should not be favorited by default)
//    Games added should be unique in your collection by name. If you try to add with the same name, it should not be added.
//    Find a game by name (several features could use this method to complete their task)
//    Remove a game by name (should do nothing if the game is not found)
//    Favorite a game by name (should do nothing if the game is not found)
//    Un-Favorite a game by nameÂ (should do nothing if the game is not found)
//    Get all games as a collection (used for LibraryRunner display)
//    Should build, run, and not crash.
